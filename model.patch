+      ✅ 1 Month Period (period=1mnth): Returns 5 weekly bars with week_start/week_end timestamps
+      ✅ 6 Months Period (period=6mnth): Returns 6 monthly bars with proper month names
+      ✅ 1 Year Period (period=1yr): Returns 6 bi-monthly bars with 'Feb-Mar' style labels
+      ✅ Category Breakdown: Date range filtering works correctly (2025-12-01 to 2025-12-08)
+      ✅ Merchant Leaderboard: Date range filtering and limit=10 parameter work correctly
+      
+      All APIs return proper data structures with expected fields and correct amounts.
